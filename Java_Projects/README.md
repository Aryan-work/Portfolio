# Portfolio
This is a compilation of all my work in Java! I hope to continue to add new projects to this as I continue to learn. 

To view the work in each file, click on it and "view raw". This should download a folder onto your computer with my code and test files.

THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER WORK
  I am yet to find more of my projects from my old computer to add in this repo
